Transcription:

like now I wanted to demo it a little bit and show some people that I knew, but I realized they'd be looking at it on their phones and I didn't build it for phone at first. I built it for desktop. And when I brought it down to a phone, I realized like all the dimensions were all wrong and the scrolling was very different and all that stuff. So, you know, I kind of just made it work, but I wasn't super happy with it. I was like, okay, at least it's supported on the phone, but I could say it's a lot better on desktop. So, you know, that's at least a stepping stone. But that was just one more anxiety that I felt of like, you know, I didn't really finish that. And then I realized that on little slower CPUs, the frame rates would get pretty messed up. I also at first had this like cool SVG distortion filter that I was playing around with to make the water kind of wavy in front of the SVGs. And it looked really cool, but it just destroyed the frame rate. And so I was just left with this project that I couldn't really demo or show because I wasn't proud of it because the frame rate was terrible and I hadn't optimized it and figured it out despite putting a bit of time into it. And that haunted me for like months. Every time I thought about it, I didn't think of it as like, oh, I learned all this cool stuff and I kind of finished this project. It was just like, oh, it's just another project that I didn't finish and I really need to go back and do it. So I think you get the point now. And what, you know, until I reflected on this idea of treating your projects as success, even when you don't finish them, I wasn't very proud of that. And all the work that I put in was just kind of thrown away and it actually ended up serving to just give me more anxiety. But after really thinking about that, you know, it put things into perspective and it helped me re-clarify and refocus like, yeah, I did that. And now I can do something cooler next time. So that real world example was just to kind of show you on a personal level that I feel this as well, just to give a little bit more context and especially for, you know, younger, newer developers, that, you know, people that have been doing it for many years feel the exact same thing all the time. It doesn't matter how good you get or how cool is something you make. If you let yourself, you'll be disappointed in it. You'll never really feel like you accomplished that thing unless you sit back and reflect on that and let it go and move on to the next thing. This is what works for me. This is usually what makes me the happiest, makes me continue to progress and, you know, improve my craft. If it doesn't work for you, I'm sorry about that, but I hope that it will work for some of you and will be useful to you. Thanks for watching and I hope to see you in the next one.

SUMMARY 1:

In the video 'Succeed by coding like a Necromancer', the speaker discusses the importance of treating unfinished projects as a success and how it can help web developers learn and grow in their craft. The speaker shares a personal example of a project they had worked on, which they initially felt disappointed about due to various issues such as frame rate and mobile compatibility. However, after reflecting on the idea of treating the project as a success, they were able to put things into perspective and appreciate the learning experience.

The speaker emphasizes that even experienced developers can feel disappointment and anxiety when their projects don't turn out as planned. It's essential to take a step back, reflect on the accomplishments, and acknowledge what has been learned to move forward and continue progressing in the craft.

In conclusion, the video encourages developers to adopt a mindset of treating unfinished projects as successes, as it can lead to a more positive outlook on their work, continuous progress, and improvement in their skills. While this approach may not work for everyone, the speaker hopes that it can be beneficial for some developers and help them in their journey.
