In this video, I discuss imposter syndrome and how to manage it. I share five tips that have helped me manage my own imposter syndrome in my coding journey.

1. Accept that most people have imposter syndrome. It's widespread, and many people feel it, regardless of their experience. Keep in mind that your circle of influence is small compared to the vast world out there, and you should be objective about it to stay sane.

2. Recognize that all great developers have gaps in their knowledge. Developers like Dan Abramov have even published blog posts acknowledging the things they don't know. This is a reminder that it's okay not to know everything and that making mistakes is part of the learning process.

3. Expose your weaknesses. Be honest about the areas where you lack experience, and ask questions to learn from others. This will help you build trust with your colleagues and avoid pretending to know things you don't.

4. Use the Anxiety Stack. This is a method I created to help manage imposter syndrome. Create a list of things you don't know, and once a week, take 25 minutes to learn about one of the items on the list. This can help alleviate anxiety and broaden your skillset.

5. Keep a journal. Jot down things you learn and review it every six months to a year. This can help you see how much you've learned and provide a pick-me-up when you're feeling down.

These tips have helped me manage imposter syndrome, and I hope they can be helpful to you as well. Remember, making mistakes is part of the learning process, and it's okay not to know everything.
