In this video, I discuss imposter syndrome and how to manage it. I share five tips that I've found helpful in managing my own imposter syndrome:

1. Accept that most people have imposter syndrome: Recognize that it's not just rookies or new people to a profession who experience it; it's widespread and affects many people, even those who have been in their jobs for over a decade. Understand that comparing yourself to others on social media is not a healthy way to evaluate your own abilities.

2. Recognize that all great developers have gaps: No one knows everything, and even the most experienced developers have areas where they lack knowledge or expertise. Be aware that people may present an idealized version of themselves online, but they are still making mistakes and learning just like you.

3. Expose your weaknesses: Be honest about the areas where you lack experience or knowledge, and ask questions to learn more. This can help you gain respect from others and make it easier to learn and grow in your career.

4. Use the "Anxiety Stack" technique: Make a list of the things that you don't know but feel you should, and then set aside time each week to learn about one of those topics. This can help alleviate anxiety and broaden your skillset.

5. Keep a journal: Documenting what you've learned and how you felt before and after learning it can help you see your progress over time and remind you of how much you've grown.

Overall, managing imposter syndrome is about acknowledging that it's a common experience and finding ways to grow and learn from it. By being honest about your weaknesses, embracing your gaps in knowledge, and actively working to improve, you can become a more confident and capable developer.
