Summaries:better, and I wanted to have like an intro or maybe like a user interface that would allow you to switch between the different frameworks, and then I wanted to maybe add some more animations or have more scenes or create a whole story. And all of this just kept piling up on me, and I never actually felt like I accomplished anything. I never felt like it was a success. I just saw it as another unfinished project, even though I had learned so much and I had actually built something that I was proud of. So, coding like a necromancer means to me to look at all those projects, all those corpses in your graveyard as successes, even if they're not complete. Because every single one of those projects was a stepping stone to learn something new, to build something better, and to improve your skills. It's okay to let go of some projects, especially if you're moving on to something else. It's okay to start over and learn from your mistakes, and it's important to not let the anxiety of unfinished projects weigh you down. Instead, treat all those project corpses as fuel for your future endeavors, and embrace the graveyard of projects as a testament to your growth, learning, and progress. So, remember, code like a necromancer, and embrace your graveyard of projects as successes.

In the video 'Succeed by coding like a Necromancer', the speaker discusses the importance of treating unfinished projects as a success and how it can help web developers learn and grow in their craft. The speaker shares a personal example of a project they had worked on, which they initially felt disappointed about due to various issues such as frame rate and mobile compatibility. However, after reflecting on the idea of treating the project as a success, they were able to put things into perspective and appreciate the learning experience.

The speaker emphasizes that even experienced developers can feel disappointment and anxiety when their projects don't turn out as planned. It's essential to take a step back, reflect on the accomplishments, and acknowledge what has been learned to move forward and continue progressing in the craft.

In conclusion, the video encourages developers to adopt a mindset of treating unfinished projects as successes, as it can lead to a more positive outlook on their work, continuous progress, and improvement in their skills. While this approach may not work for everyone, the speaker hopes that it can be beneficial for some developers and help them in their journey.
