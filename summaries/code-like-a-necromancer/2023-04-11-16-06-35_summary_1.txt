TRANSCRIPTION:

like now I wanted to demo it a little bit and show some people that I knew, but I realized they'd be looking at it on their phones and I didn't build it for phone at first. I built it for desktop. And when I brought it down to a phone, I realized like all the dimensions were all wrong and the scrolling was very different and all that stuff. So, you know, I kind of just made it work, but I wasn't super happy with it. I was like, okay, at least it's supported on the phone, but I could say it's a lot better on desktop. So, you know, that's at least a stepping stone. But that was just one more anxiety that I felt of like, you know, I didn't really finish that. And then I realized that on little slower CPUs, the frame rates would get pretty messed up. I also at first had this like cool SVG distortion filter that I was playing around with to make the water kind of wavy in front of the SVGs. And it looked really cool, but it just destroyed the frame rate. And so I was just left with this project that I couldn't really demo or show because I wasn't proud of it because the frame rate was terrible and I hadn't optimized it and figured it out despite putting a bit of time into it. And that haunted me for like months. Every time I thought about it, I didn't think of it as like, oh, I learned all this cool stuff and I kind of finished this project. It was just like, oh, it's just another project that I didn't finish and I really need to go back and do it. So I think you get the point now. And what, you know, until I reflected on this idea of treating your projects as success, even when you don't finish them, I wasn't very proud of that. And all the work that I put in was just kind of thrown away and it actually ended up serving to just give me more anxiety. But after really thinking about that, you know, it put things into perspective and it helped me re-clarify and refocus like, yeah, I did that. And now I can do something cooler next time. So that real world example was just to kind of show you on a personal level that I feel this as well, just to give a little bit more context and especially for, you know, younger, newer developers, that, you know, people that have been doing it for many years feel the exact same thing all the time. It doesn't matter how good you get or how cool is something you make. If you let yourself, you'll be disappointed in it. You'll never really feel like you accomplished that thing unless you sit back and reflect on that and let it go and move on to the next thing. This is what works for me. This is usually what makes me the happiest, makes me continue to progress and, you know, improve my craft. If it doesn't work for you, I'm sorry about that, but I hope that it will work for some of you and will be useful to you. Thanks for watching and I hope to see you in the next one.

SUMMARY 1:

In the video 'Succeed by coding like a Necromancer', I discussed the importance of recognizing success in unfinished projects and not letting them weigh you down. I shared a personal example of a web development project I worked on, where I built an interactive JavaScript animation for desktops. However, I faced various challenges when trying to make it compatible with mobile devices and optimizing its performance.

These issues made me feel anxious and unsatisfied with my work, and I couldn't bring myself to showcase the project to others. This feeling of not completing a project haunted me for months, and I felt like I had wasted my time and effort.

After reflecting on this experience, I realized that it's essential to treat your projects as successful even if they are not fully completed. This perspective shift helped me acknowledge the skills and knowledge I gained from the project rather than dwelling on its imperfections.

I emphasized that this feeling of disappointment and anxiety is common among developers, regardless of their experience level. The key to overcoming this is to sit back, reflect on your accomplishments, and let go of the project's shortcomings. This approach has worked for me, helping me stay happy, continue progressing, and improve my craft.

In conclusion, recognizing success in unfinished projects can help alleviate anxiety and dissatisfaction, allowing you to move on and tackle new challenges with confidence. While this method may not work for everyone, I hope it can benefit some developers and encourage them to keep learning and growing.
