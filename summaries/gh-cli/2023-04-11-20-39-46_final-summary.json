{"summary": "In this video, I demonstrated how to streamline your repo workflow with Github CLI, a powerful tool for web developers. To get started, you can install the CLI tool from CLI.github.com. I discussed various practical commands, including gh repo create, gh repo list, gh repo edit, gh pr create, gh pr view, gh pr edit, gh pr list, gh pr merge, gh pr checkout, and gh pr status. These commands help save time and effort when managing repositories and pull requests, and can be even more efficient when combined with snippets in tools like Raycast.\n\nI then explained the gh pr status command, which displays the list of pull requests (PRs) that affect you. I demonstrated how the CLI tool can be useful for workflows involving tests, Linton tests, or continuous integration actions, and showed an example of creating a PR that would purposely fail tests while using gh PR view to check the workflow status.\n\nAdditionally, I covered the gist commands in Github CLI, which allow you to create, list, and view gists efficiently. I showcased how to use gh gist list, gh gist view, and gh gist clone for managing gists. Lastly, I introduced the gh search repos command, which enables you to search for specific repos by tags or names, output the results in JSON format, and select specific properties to include in the output.\n\nIn conclusion, Github CLI offers a wide range of powerful commands and features to help streamline your repo workflow, making it an invaluable tool for web developers.", "title": "Streamline your repo workflow with Github CLI", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=in_H8MbiHpw"}
