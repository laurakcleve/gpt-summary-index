Summaries:

In this video, I demonstrated how to use the Github CLI to streamline my repo workflow. I began by introducing the Github CLI and explaining its benefits, as well as providing a link to the CLI installation process. Once installed, I showcased various practical commands that have improved my workflow, such as creating a new repository, listing repositories, and editing repo visibility.

I then shared how I use snippets in conjunction with the Github CLI for an even more efficient workflow. Using tools like Raycast, I can quickly create and edit repos without needing to navigate through the web UI.

Next, I demonstrated how to use the Github CLI for creating and managing pull requests. The commands I covered include creating a new PR, viewing PR details, editing PRs, listing all PRs, and merging PRs. I also showed how to check out PRs and resolve conflicts using the Github CLI.

Finally, I discussed the PR status command, which provides a quick overview of all PRs in the repository.

In summary, the Github CLI has significantly improved and sped up my repo workflow by allowing me to perform common tasks directly from the command line. By utilizing practical commands and integrating snippets, I can efficiently create and manage repositories, pull requests, and more.

In this video, I discussed how to streamline repo workflows using the GitHub CLI. I began by explaining how the gh pr status command is helpful for listing PRs that affect you, such as the current branch's PR, all PRs created by you, and any that request a code review from you.

Next, I demonstrated how the CLI tool can be useful for workflows like tests, Linton tests, or continuous integration actions by purposely making a commit that fails the tests and creating a PR for it. I also showed how to use the gh PR view command to check the status of your checks and workflows.

I then discussed the usefulness of the gist commands, which allow you to create, list, and view gists more easily. I showed how to create a gist by pointing the command to a file, list all of your gists with gh gist list, and view a gist using the gh gist view command with an ID.

I also demonstrated how to send a gist into a file on Nix based systems and how to use the gist clone command to create a directory with multiple files. However, I noted that I haven't figured out how to do this without creating a directory.

Finally, I showcased the gh search repos command, which can be used to search for specific types of repos with tags or names. This command can output JSON with specified properties, allowing for potential sorting or other automated tasks. Although I acknowledged that this particular command may not be practical for everyday use, it demonstrates the power and versatility of the GitHub CLI.

Overall, the GitHub CLI can be a valuable tool for web developers looking to streamline their repo workflows. With various commands and options available, it offers a high level of customization and automation possibilities.
