{"summary": "In this video, we explore eight simple but underused terminal commands that can significantly improve the workflow of web developers. Four of these commands are bash commands, while the other four are specific to omizsh. These commands can optimize and simplify various tasks, making them essential for developers who want to increase their productivity.\n\nWe begin by discussing Ctrl + R, a command that enables recall mode and searches your history, making it easier to find specific keywords within your command history. Next, we cover the Directory Stack, which allows you to navigate through your history of visited directories like an array indexing. By pressing one, you go back to the last position, two goes back two positions, and so on.\n\nWe then move on to the D command, exclusive to ZSH, which displays the directory stack and enables you to jump to specific directories using their index number. We also discuss how ZSH allows you to change multiple directories at once using the cd command with additional dots, each representing one level up in the directory structure.\n\nThe video continues with the ll command, a shorthand for 'ls -lh' that lists directories in a long list format with human-readable file sizes. We also discuss the Command + Grep, a helpful tool that pipes the output of a command to grep, allowing you to search for specific keywords within the output. This is particularly useful for filtering large outputs and quickly finding specific information.\n\nNext, we explore the Make Dir -p command, which enables you to create a nested directory structure in one command. By using '&&', you can chain commands, such as creating a directory and immediately changing into it with 'cd $_'. Lastly, we discuss the Take command, exclusive to ZSH, which combines 'mkdir -p' and 'cd' into one concise command, streamlining the process of creating and navigating to new directories.\n\nThese eight terminal commands can greatly enhance your efficiency when working in the terminal. By customizing or aliasing these commands, you can further streamline your workflow and improve your overall productivity as a web developer.", "title": "8 Simple but Underused Terminal Commands", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xpp8DW2eUUA"}
