{"summary": "In the video \"Succeed by coding like a Necromancer,\" the speaker shares his personal experience of working on a project that did not meet his expectations. He initially built the project for desktop, but encountered issues when attempting to demo it on a mobile device, as the dimensions and scrolling were off. Despite trying to make it work on mobile devices, he was not fully satisfied with the outcome. He also faced performance problems on slower CPUs and struggled with an SVG distortion filter that negatively impacted the frame rate. This left him feeling disappointed and haunted by his unfinished project, causing anxiety and a lack of pride in his work.\n\nHowever, after reflecting on his experiences, the speaker realized the importance of embracing both finished and unfinished projects as successes, as long as valuable lessons were learned from them. By treating each project as an opportunity for growth and development, he was able to let go of his disappointment and move on to improve his craft. He emphasizes the importance of building a library of code and experience from each project, which will ultimately lead to success as a developer.\n\nThe main takeaway from the video is to not let the anxiety of unfinished projects hold you back, but rather use them as fuel for growth and development in the coding world. The speaker encourages younger and newer developers to embrace their \"graveyard\" of projects, recognizing that even experienced developers face challenges and setbacks. By reflecting on and accepting unfinished projects as successes, developers can feel happier, more accomplished, and continue to progress in their careers. This approach may not work for everyone, but it has proven helpful for the speaker and could potentially benefit others as well.", "title": "Succeed by coding like a Necromancer", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UstaGlORbtA"}
