{"summary": "In this video, I demonstrated how to streamline repo workflows using the Github CLI, a powerful tool that has significantly improved and sped up my repo workflow by allowing me to perform common tasks directly from the command line. I began by introducing the Github CLI and explaining its benefits, as well as providing a link to the CLI installation process.\n\nI showcased various practical commands, such as creating a new repository, listing repositories, editing repo visibility, and using snippets in conjunction with the Github CLI for an even more efficient workflow. By using tools like Raycast, I can quickly create and edit repos without needing to navigate through the web UI.\n\nNext, I demonstrated how to use the Github CLI for creating and managing pull requests. The commands I covered include creating a new PR, viewing PR details, editing PRs, listing all PRs, merging PRs, checking out PRs, and resolving conflicts. I also discussed the gh pr status command, which provides a quick overview of all PRs in the repository that affect you, such as the current branch's PR, all PRs created by you, and any that request a code review from you.\n\nI showed how the CLI tool can be useful for workflows like tests, Linton tests, or continuous integration actions by purposely making a commit that fails the tests and creating a PR for it. I also demonstrated how to use the gh PR view command to check the status of your checks and workflows.\n\nAdditionally, I discussed the gist commands, which allow you to create, list, and view gists more easily. I showed how to create a gist by pointing the command to a file, list all of your gists with gh gist list, and view a gist using the gh gist view command with an ID. I also demonstrated how to send a gist into a file on Nix based systems and how to use the gist clone command to create a directory with multiple files.\n\nFinally, I showcased the gh search repos command, which can be used to search for specific types of repos with tags or names. This command can output JSON with specified properties, allowing for potential sorting or other automated tasks. Although I acknowledged that this particular command may not be practical for everyday use, it demonstrates the power and versatility of the GitHub CLI.\n\nIn conclusion, the Github CLI has greatly enhanced my repo workflow by utilizing practical commands and integrating snippets to efficiently create and manage repositories, pull requests, and more. It's a valuable tool for web developers looking to streamline their workflows, offering a high level of customization and automation possibilities.", "title": "Streamline your repo workflow with Github CLI", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=in_H8MbiHpw"}
