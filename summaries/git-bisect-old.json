{"summary": "In the given example, the user utilizes the powerful 'git bisect' tool to quickly find the origin of a bug in a codebase. Git bisect performs a binary search between a known good commit and a known bad commit to identify which commit introduced the bug. The user demonstrates the process, starting with 'git bisect start', marking commits as good or bad, and continuing until the first bad commit is found. They also show how to use 'git bisect run' to automate the process by running tests automatically for each commit, which can save time in large codebases.\n\nIn cases where the codebase does not have tests, the user writes a test based on the current state of the code and leaves it untracked. They then run 'git bisect run' with the untracked test, and it is still able to find the first bad commit. This technique is particularly useful for quickly identifying the origin of a bug, especially in large codebases with many commits, ensuring that the codebase remains stable and bug-free.", "title": "Using git bisect to quickly find the origin of a bug", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aulaZBVS16g"}
