{"summary": "In the video 'Succeed by coding like a Necromancer', I discuss the significance of viewing unfinished projects as successes and how this mindset can help web developers learn and grow in their craft. I share a personal example of a project I had worked on, which initially left me feeling disappointed due to various issues such as frame rate and mobile compatibility. However, after adopting the perspective of treating the project as a success, I was able to appreciate the learning experience.\n\nI emphasize that even experienced developers can experience disappointment and anxiety when their projects don't turn out as planned. It's crucial to take a step back, reflect on the accomplishments, and acknowledge the lessons learned to move forward and continue progressing in the craft.\n\nI conclude by encouraging my fellow developers to adopt this mindset of treating unfinished projects as successes, as it can lead to a more positive outlook on our work, continuous progress, and improvement in our skills. Although this approach may not work for everyone, I hope that it can be beneficial for some developers and aid them in their journey.\n\nAs I code like a necromancer, I embrace my graveyard of projects as a testament to my growth, learning, and progress. I view each project corpse as fuel for my future endeavors and don't let the anxiety of unfinished projects weigh me down. Instead, I learn from my mistakes, start over when necessary, and ultimately celebrate my successes, no matter how small they may seem.", "title": "Succeed by coding like a Necromancer", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UstaGlORbtA"}
